RESULTS after updating the I2C baudrate to 800000 (this value is the highest we can set for i2c without exp i/o or conection fails) in /boot/config.txt (https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/02/change-raspberry-pi-i2c-bus-speed/):

********SPI Interface********

Use library: spidev
Documentation: https://www.sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/rpi/dnld/draft_spidev_doc.pdf

The 125 MHz default value is not sustainable on a Raspberry Pi and it must be changed to a reasonable value. The maximum speed appears to be about 32 MHz on the Raspberry Pi. This can be set using the 'max_speed_hz' method. There is a debate about permissible speed values, with some insisting that the speed must be a power of 2, while others argue that it can be a multiple of 2. Tests at least partially confirm that the latter is correct. It was possible to set the speed at 3800 Hz, which appears to be a lower limit, and at 4800 Hz. Neither of these values is a power of 2.

*************SPI-INTERFACE***************

Note: Use Geany Editor for benchmarking as IDE can have small effect on the benchmarking. A difference of 4000uS was observed while running the same code in VS Code and Geany, Geany being the faster one.

SPI Speed set at Default Value which is 125Mhz for these measurements. Anything beyond this does not make a significant change in the speeds.

## ESP32 Projects
### 1. Hosting a website
This project is a simple website hosted on the ESP32 Microcontroller. The website is hosted on an Async Webserver and the ESP32 is configured in Access Point mode. The HTML files for the website are stored on the SPIFFS memory of the ESP32. These files can be found in the "data" folder within the sketch folder.
